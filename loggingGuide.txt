Logging guide from python:
    DEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.

    INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected.

    WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g.
    ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected.

    ERROR: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.

    CRITICAL: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.


what i've been using
    DEBUG: To determine which branch of an if/else was executed. Also if a variable needs to be logged such as an
    array index, variable size on disk, exception etc, debug is used

    INFO: When something occurs in the program, usually at the end of a function, or after an important action is taken,
    for example deleting the contents of an array, changing a widget on the GUI, creating a file, etc.

    WARNING: When the program behaves unexpectedly, such as a dicom file has a corrupted image,  but can continue
    performing

    ERROR: the program needs to end execution due to an error. Not implemented

    CRITICAL: The program is threatening the operation of the user's computer, for example an infinite loop, deleting
    files, using too much ram etc. Not implemented

please note: we have tried to maintain this formatting, but some of the logging was implemented before we agreed on
this. If you find logging in our code that does not conform to this, please message Alex, Allen, Dylan or Sam on the
slack
